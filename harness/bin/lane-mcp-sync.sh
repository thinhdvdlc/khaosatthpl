# Give a lane the same MCP servers as the source project (SOURCE_REPO).
# Root cause this fixes: the playwright/* MCPs are registered LOCAL-scope for
# the source project in ~/.claude.json, so lane sessions get none.
#
# What it does (per lane):
#   1. Reads the source project's mcpServers from ~/.claude.json (read-only).
#   2. Rewrites any absolute path under the source repo -> the lane's path
#      (per-lane Chromium profiles; shared profiles would SingletonLock-collide).
#   3. Seeds the lane's .playwright-mcp/profiles/* by copying the source
#      profiles once (preserves tracker/dev-site logins), dropping Singleton*.
#   4. Writes <lane>/.mcp.json (project-scope MCP config, read at session start).
#   5. Writes lane-scoped permission allow-rules into
#      <lane>/.claude/settings.local.json: enableAllProjectMcpServers + an
#      `mcp__<server>` allow rule for every synced server's tools, the GitHub PR
#      flow (comment/review/create/edit/view/diff/list/api/auth), and git push —
#      so autonomous lane sessions don't stop for approvals (never merge/close).
#      Plus a NARROW auto-mode `allow` rule (a separate classifier layer) so the
#      ticketer / pr-reviewer sub-agents can do their ONE configured external write
#      (file a ticket / post a review) unattended — the ticket rule only when
#      TRACKER_ENABLED=1. Not mode:bypassPermissions (the classifier flags that).
#   6. Excludes .mcp.json from git via .git/info/exclude.
# Re-runnable. New/changed servers re-sync; existing lane profiles are kept.
